    <h2>When and Where:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This course is online. That includes all lectures, review sessions and office hours. </li>
        <li>Officially we meet on Mondays and Wednesdays, 12:30 - 1:50 pm.  Note that I will use these hours to answer questions about recent material, and possibly go over an occasional practice problem. I will not to hold live lectures during these hours.  I will also hold other office hours each week.</li>
        <li><a name="class">
    On the </a><a href="resources.html">Resources page</a> you can find pre-recorded lectures from recent semesters. There are also screen recordings of the lecture notes, with narrations (recorded in the past couple months).  These resources, in combination with frequent office hours, are more than enough to replace live lectures.
    
     You should follow up with me or with TAs via email, Piazza or Zoom whenever you have questions.

    <b>Non-required textbook: </b> Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd edition, by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.
     This is commonly just referred to as ``CLRS". 
    More info at </a><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms"> MIT press</a>.
    
    Note: my Resources page refers to this book so you can find relevant chapters if you wish.  The course doesn't explicitly rely on the book though.  Also, this book is massive.  We will not cover everything in it.   See "Topics" below. 
    
    </p><p>
    <!-- <b>Even more non-required textbook: </b>
    Algorithms, by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou and Vazirani.
    
    This book has been used at NYU in previous semesters. It is smaller and cheaper than CLRS.  It does not contain everything that I will teach.  -->
    
    </p><p>
    <b>Prerequisites:  </b> Discrete math is important. Basic understanding of some data structures and probability will matter too.  Overall, you should possess 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20mathematical%20maturity%20is,that%20cannot%20be%20directly%20taught.">mathematical maturity</a>.
    
    <!-- Technically, OOP is a prerequisite but my course does not rely on this directly. -->
    See the Resources page and search for the word "prerequisite" to see when you will need to know background material. 
    You will probably find this course difficult if you're not comfortable with induction, recursion and proofs, or if big-O seems like a challenging concept.  It is assumed that you know the basics about arrays, linked lists and trees. Knowledge of basic probability will be helpful for two or three lectures but I will recap what you need to know.
    <!-- <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/Undergraduate-Courses.html"> (source)</a> -->
     If you have not done well in discrete math or have not passed data structures, you should contact me. 
    
    
    </p><p>
    
    <b>Topics: </b>
    
    This is an introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms, which involves discussing a few basic data structures as well.    Many topics could fit in such a course, and not all intro courses go over exactly the same material. 
     We will place all emphasis on theory instead of programming.  This course is about figuring out how to solve a problem before you start coding.

    </a></p><ul><a name="grading">
        
        <li> I initially wanted to fit in 5 exams but that doesn't work well.  We will have 4 exams, including the final.  Each will be worth 25% of the final grade.
    	 See the Schedule page for dates.  The duration of each exam will probably be approximately 80 minutes. 
    
        
        <!--
        <li>Exam 1,  around March 4, worth 30%, covering everything up to 7 days before (inclusive). Duration 80 minutes.
        
        <li>Exam 2,  around April 17, worth 30%, covering everything after exam 1 up to 7 days before. Duration 80 minutes. 
        
        <li>Exam 3,  during final exam week, worth 40%. 30% of this covers everything after exam 2, and 10% covers material corresponding to the first two exams.  Duration 2 hours.
        
            
    
    
     All exams are closed book. No notes whatsoever.
    
     
     
     You will have the option to take exams on campus. I will reserve a room. 
     Otherwise you must find a proctor at a university, high school, library or testing center near you, and submit their info to Tandon Online.  The exams of this course are not compatible with services like ProctorU.
     -->
     
    </li><li> I will most likely use Gradescope for exams. You will need to type your answers directly into Gradescope.
    </li><li> Unless the pandemic situation changes, all exams will be open book. You may refer to my course notes and videos, the textbook, and generally any resource that I have provided. You may not use the internet in any other way. This also means that you may not refer to your own notes if they were based on material found online or other sources besides those  listed above.  You may not collaborate during exams.  Violation of these rules will result in an F in the course and a report to administration.
    
    
    
        
    </li><li>Homework is worth 0%.  If you submit it, we will grade it and provide feedback, but this is done purely so that you can practice and understand where you made mistakes. 
      
    
    
    </li></a></ul><a name="grading">
    
    
    <!--
    <B>Late homework:</b>
    
    Unless mentioned otherwise on a homework assignment, the following will apply: 
    If you are 0-24 hours late there is a 25% penalty.  If you are 24-48 hours late there is a 50% penalty.  After that you do not get credit. 
    
    
    
    
    
    <b>Missed homework:</b>
    There will be 20 homework "units". 
      If you fail to submit 5 or more units without justification, your final grade will drop by a letter (e.g., B to C).  
       If you fail to submit 8 or more  units, you will not pass the course. 
        Furthermore, submitting an answer that shows almost no effort or understanding will also count towards this rule.  
     Homework submitted within the 48-hour late window does not  count as missed. 
    
    
    </ul>
    -->
    
    <b>Excused absence:</b>
    If you have a serious reason for not taking an exam, you should notify your Dean and/or Health Services, and of course you may CC me as well. 
    <!-- There is no penalty if you do not attend lectures.  -->
    
    
    I cannot arrange a makeup exam if you have a predictable conflict that could be reasonably avoided.  Check the  exam schedule before making plans. 
    
    
    <b> Important note:  </b> 
    <!--
    Do not assume that the numerical score you receive on homework or exams directly corresponds to a particular letter grade.  Your score is just a number that lets me figure out who is doing better or worse than average.  Don't panic if you think you scored low.  An evaluation of your performance will be given after each exam: you will see a plot of exam scores and a letter grade estimate.  You will also receive updates about average homework performance. 
    
    -->
    The way I have taught the course until now, exam scores are typically low;  the median is usually around 50 and often in the 40's.  Few students get over 80%. 
    Although the median exam score is often low and can vary, and I may curve accordingly, an exam score under  30% is a strong indication that you have not comprehended the material well enough to pass the course. 
    
    
    <b>Warning:</b>
    If you need credit for this course in order to graduate or maintain a scholarship, it is your responsibility to do well.  There will be no extra credit options.  Rather than notifying me after the final exam that your life will be ruined if you don't get a good grade, discuss your situation with me when the course begins!

    Ideally your submissions should be typed.  You may include figures, in fact you are encouraged to do so. If the figures are  photographs or scans of work done on paper, it is your responsibility to make sure that they are clear, with proper contrast and resolution. 
    <!-- If not, it should be produced by writing extremely clearly and scanning with good contrast.  -->
    There should be no shadows, coffee mugs, pets, body parts, etc, visible in your figures.
     <!-- Also, it  helps if your file is not massive. That just slows down Gradescope. 1-2MB should be more than enough. -->
     In general, leave enough space so we can annotate with comments.

    <b>Tips for doing well in this course, if you find it challenging:  </b>
    </a></p><ul><a name="tips">
    
    <!--
    <li>
    Come to class!   However, don't expect that all you need to do is show up and simply soak in information.   Lectures should serve as an introduction to material, which you should further study on your own later.   
    If you find that the in-class pace is too fast, consider reading some basic material beforehand. 
    
    
    <li>
    Taking extensive notes in class works well for some people, but keep in mind that all class notes displayed are already available to you.
    Consider bringing a printout of the <i>condensed</i> notes to class.   Then you can mark your own observations, clarifications and questions quickly, and spend more time paying attention.
    
    -->
    
    <li>
    Use the <i>full</i> version of the course notes when studying, <i>not</i> the condensed version.   Try to anticipate what is coming next.  Try to re-prove things.  Derive on your own, rather than verifying what is written.   When you simply verify what's there, it is easy to overestimate what you've understood.  
    
    
    </li><li>
    Don't cram.  The most common reason students don't do well on the exams in this course is that they think they can learn the material for an exam in two days.
    
    
    Spend time on this course regularly.   Many students underestimate how much time is required to truly understand some of these topics.  
    
    </li><li>
    Use all resources available:   class notes, the summary PDF document at the top of the Resources page, the  videos, the book, the web.  Do practice problems from the book, starting with the more basic ones.   In many cases you can make your own practice problems (e.g. draw an arbitrary graph and find shortest paths). 
    
    </li><li>
    As much as possible, don't memorize.  Instead, understand.  I do realize that some basic memory is required in any case. But if you think you need to memorize how algorithms work,  why they are correct, or what their time complexities are, then you're not approaching this course correctly and should talk to me.  
    
    </li><li>
    Pretend that you will have to teach the material that you're reading, to 100 people.
    
    
    
    </li><li>
    Try to do the homework on your own.  If you are entirely stuck, get only basic hints from your classmates and TAs, but don't rush to do this if you've only spent an hour or two on a problem.  If you have no idea how to approach a problem, then you probably need to study the basics a bit more: take the time to review the material from the corresponding lectures, and solve some easier exercises on your own. Then think about what tools you have just learned about, and whether they might help.  If none of this works, then get some hints.  Homework sometimes requires multiple hours of work.
    
    </li><li>
    When stuck solving homework problems, see how you'd handle a made-up example.    Think about whether your example is oversimplified, whether you've made unnecessary assumptions, and whether your solution is generalizable (if applicable).  Also, sometimes it's a good idea to add extra assumptions, thus making the problem easier to solve, and gradually remove the assumptions. 
    
    </li><li> 
    Read the homework solutions even if you got a good score.  Sometimes graders don't notice subtle mistakes on homework submissions. Reading the solutions might help you avoid repeating such mistakes on an exam.  Also, even if your ideas worked, the solutions might have a  more efficient idea or description that will end up worth knowing about.  In any case, it is your responsibility to be familiar with homework solutions, because they might appear on exams.
    
    </li><li>
    Don't hesitate to talk to me and to the TAs.
